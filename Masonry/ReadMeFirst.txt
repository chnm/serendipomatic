You need to use three files:
/demos/images.html
/css/style.css
/demos/images folder for the example images

To do:
1. Remove example images, make pull in images/data from black box, uncomment/switch in <img> tags that draw their dimensions (height and width attributes) from the image ID (1-10)
2. backface-visibility: hidden currently isn't working for some reason. This needs to be fixed so that data on "back" of card doesn't show through the front
3. Test in Firefox, Chrome, and mobile once correctly pulling in data and images to make sure masonry is working correctly.
