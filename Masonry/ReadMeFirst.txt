/demos/images.html
/css/style.css
/demos/images folder for the example images
hflip.js
jquery.isotope/js
/js folder

To do:
1. Remove example images, make pull in images/data from black box, uncomment/switch in <img> tags that draw their dimensions (height and width attributes) from the image ID (1-10)

3. Test in Firefox, Chrome, and mobile once correctly pulling in data and images to make sure masonry is working correctly.
