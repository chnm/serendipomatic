If extra stopwords for a particular language are needed, a file should
be created in this directory using the naming convention of two-letter
language code .txt, e.g. en.txt for English or de.text for German.  (See
the stopword language mapping listed in smartstash.core.util for
the two-letter codes curerntly in use.)

Files should contain one stopword per line, with no other content.
