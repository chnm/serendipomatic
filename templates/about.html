<h2>What it is</h2>

<p>Serendip-o-matic connects your sources to digital materials located in libraries, museums, and archives around the world. By first examining your research interests, and then identifying related content in locations such as the Digital Public Library of America and Europeana, our serendipity engine helps you discover photographs, documents, maps and other primary sources.</p>

<p>Whether you begin with text from an article, a Wikipedia page, or a full Zotero collection, Serendip-o-matic's special algorithm extracts key terms and returns a surprising reflection of your interests. Because the tool is designed mostly for inspiration, search results aren't meant to be exhaustive, but rather suggestive, pointing you to materials you might not have discovered. At the very least, the magical input-output process helps you step back and look at your work from a new perspective. Give it a whirl. Your sources may surprise you.</p>

<h2>How we built it</h2>

<p>Serendip-o-matic is the product of <a href="http://www.oneweekonetool.org/" target="_blank">One Week | One Tool</a>, an open-source software-development institute sponsored by the <a href="http://www.neh.gov/" target="_blank">National Endowment for the Humanities</a> and hosted by the <a href="http://chnm.gmu.edu/" target="_blank">Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media</a> at <a href="http://www.gmu.edu/" target="_blank">George Mason University</a>. Driven by the goal of building a research and teaching tool from conception to launch in one work week, twelve dynamic individuals converged on CHNM in the summer of 2013. Working in the spirit of a digital humanities "barn raising," team members capitalized on their diverse perspectives and skills in order to conceive, build, test, launch, and promote Serendip-o-matic from start to finish. <a href="http://chnm.gmu.edu/news/another-week-another-tool/" target="_blank">Read more about the process</a>.</p>

<h2>Who we are</h2>

<p>We are a team of twelve scholars, students, librarians, and museum professionals.</p>
