<h2>Make unexpected connections.</h2>

<p>Serendip-o-matic helps you make new connections: between the material you already have at hand, and the universe of sources beyond your fingertips.</p>

<p>Students can use one source to point to a variety of others that expand their research opportunities.  Scholars can get inspiration for their next project, or break a writing block by finding new materials that take their thinking in a fresh direction.  Bloggers can look for images to enrich their posts.  Librarians and museum professionals can discover a wide range of items and objects from institutions beyond their own, and build bridges that make their collections more accessible.</p> 

<p>Because Serendip-o-matic asks your sources to speak for themselves, it delivers what you don't know you're looking for.</p>

<h3>Have collections to share?</h3>

<p>If you're a librarian, archivist, or museum professional interested in sharing your institution's digital collections through our serendipity engine, the easiest way is to make your materials available to one of the main content aggregators we already use.  You can <a href="http://dp.la/info/get-involved/partnerships/">partner with the Digital Public Library of America</a>, <a href="http://pro.europeana.eu/web/guest/provide-data">connect with Europeana</a>, or <a href="http://www.flickr.com/commons/register/">register your organization with Flickr Commons</a>.  To do so, you’ll need to make sure your digital collections are tagged with metadata.</p>

<p>If you're a major content aggregator &mdash; or if you have a small collection &mdash; our code is open-source and available on GitHub.  You are free and encouraged to <a href="http://github.com/chnm/serendip-o-matic/">fork our repository</a> and teach our serendipity engine to talk to your collection’s application programming interface (API).</p>

<h3>Want to improve Serendip-o-matic?</h3>

<p>If you're a developer and want to help extend what our serendipity engine can do, you can contribute your code at <a href="http://github.com/chnm/serendip-o-matic/">our GitHub Repository</a>.
